      <h3>Craft Beer Near Me</h3>
      <p class="paragraph">
          One of the great things about the independent beer scene is the variety of craft beer options you can enjoy. 
          Whether it’s a brew pub down the street, a microbrewery that’s getting a lot of buzz, or a nano brewery that 
          just opened, there is always a new craft brewery to try, and we want to make finding those places easy. Search 
          for a brewery or brew pub by name, description or amenities. Not only will you get directions to craft breweries, 
          but also the ability to connect with the brewery itself to learn more. Rather than keep looking for "craft breweries near me" 
          on a search engine, seek them out quickly and easily here!
